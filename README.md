# Five Nights at Dean's

This is a custom build combo of both [Five Nights at Freddy's gamemode](https://github.com/Xperidia/FNAFGM) and [Five Nights at Pinkie's gamemode](https://github.com/Xperidia/FNAPGM) that was made for [SuperDean](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050927126).

This custom build is incompatible with the regular builds and maps and was made with the sole intent to be used on a dedicated server.

This custom build strips away many gameplay elements and features for a more streamlined sandbox experience.

If you are really interested in this custom build, you may find a [Workshop collection](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2614722180) that also contains a [custom build](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2098828427) of the [Sugar Cube Corner](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=542724054) map which features a really big outside and other various changes...

You may start your server with `+gamemode fnapgmsbox +map fnap_scc` or `gamemode fnapgmsbox` when in the console.
